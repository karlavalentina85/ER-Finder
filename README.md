ER FINDER This app is made to help the user to find the closest Emergency Room in his/her area. The user will be able to enter in their location and a certain mile radius. The application will then list the number of emergency health locations within that location's given radius.
It features current weather so the user will know the weather in the area so they are able to plan any trips to the health locations accordingly. The application will use 'Timely and Effective Care - Hospital' API and the 'Open Weather' API.
